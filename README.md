# Splunk - Windows & Apache Servers 

Our team used Splunk to build a custom security monitoring environment for a fictional organization and tested the environment against simulated attacks.

From our developed searches, we created custom reports, and alerts to monitor the security environment. 

Lastly, to aid in determining the types of attacks the company faced, we created dashboards to display useful visualizations of our searches.

*From analyzing the logs, we determined that the Windows servers suffered a Brute Force attack and the Apache servers suffered a DDoS attack.

**This repo only includes screenshots of the dashboards and logs we created
